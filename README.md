# MNIST Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple Python script using TensorFlow to build and train a neural network model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The script `mnist_digit_recognition.py` demonstrates the following steps:
- Loading the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocessing the data (normalizing pixel values).
- Building a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- Compiling the model with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
- Training the model on the training data.
- Evaluating the model on the test data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

'pip install tensorflow matplotlib'

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Soundharya2004/TNSDC2/
2. Run the script:'python mnist_digit_recognition.py'

## Results

After training the model, you will see the evaluation results including the loss and accuracy metrics.
